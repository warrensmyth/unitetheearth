# The Earth Has a Problem
People all around the world identify as races, ethnicities and nationalities. Yet our problems are bigger than any of that. We do not yet know the full extent of the damage we have caused to our environment since the Industrial Evolution, but it becomes more obvious every day that it has been significant. We do not yet know the full extent of the damage we have caused to each other since the first countries, but it becomes more obvious every day that it has been significant. We need to come together for our sake, the environment's sake, and the progression of our species. The way we do that can take many forms, but I think a major first step is for people to identify as "of Earth" or "Earthling" before they are man, woman or something else; before they are liberal, conservative or something else; before they are American, Japanese, Russian, German or something else.
